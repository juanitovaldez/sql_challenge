# SQL Homework - Employee Database:

## Process

1. I looked at the CSV files and sketched out with pen and paper which headers had matches in other files. These would be the links when I go create and ERD.

2. I used [http://www.dbdiagrams.io](http://www.dbdiagrams.io) to write a dbml file to be interpreted and drawn as an ERD. I found this to be pretty much the same as writing SQL or perhaps even like using sqlalchemy to define the relationships. In the future I will use one of the other tools. It generated SQL to create the tables.

3. Then I created views for the required queries in case we wanted to run them in the future.  

4. I found the Easter Egg when I did Ascending instead of Descending view of last name frequency.

5. Instead of eating the cost of importing and merging data into a notebook, I did the math inside the querry.

6. The Bar graph was a simple one liner.
